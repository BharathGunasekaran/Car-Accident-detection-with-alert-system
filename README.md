Title: Car Accident Detection Using Deep Learning with Integrated Emergency Response System

The rapid development of intelligent transportation systems and the rise of smart cities have paved the way for advanced safety mechanisms in vehicular networks.This paper presents a comprehensive approach to car accident detection utilizing deep learning techniques, integrated with OpenCV for image and video processing, coupled with an emergency response system that automates emergency calls, messages, and emails.
Our system leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to analyze real-time data from vehicle sensors, dashcams, and environmental inputs. OpenCV is employed for pre-processing and extracting features from images and video feeds, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the deep learning models. The models are trained on a large dataset comprising various accident scenarios to accurately identify and classify the occurrence of an accident.
Upon detection of an accident, the system instantly triggers an emergency response protocol. 

This involves:

Emergency Call: An automated call is placed to the nearest emergency services, providing them with crucial details such as the accident location, severity, and the number of potential injuries.

Message Notification: Predefined emergency contacts are immediately notified via SMS, including information about the accident and instructions for follow-up.

Email Alert: An email is sent to the car owner's emergency contacts and insurance provider, containing detailed information and data logs of the incident.

The proposed system's efficacy is evaluated through extensive simulations and real-world testing, demonstrating high accuracy in accident detection and timely activation of the emergency response. This integration of deep learning with OpenCV and an automated alert system aims to reduce response times and enhance the chances of survival and support in the critical moments following a car accident.
